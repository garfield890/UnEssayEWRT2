            <h2>How Companies Steal and Use Your Digital Data</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Almost every time you open an app on your phone or a website on your computer, a prompt appears asking you for permission to collect and sell your personal information. They use cookies to do this.</li>
                <li>A 2025 study by the research company All About Cookies found that "40% of internet users blindly accept cookies when they get to a website" (Koebert)</li>
                <li>According to the Federal Trade Commission, companies then use third-party trackers to "gather analytics about your visit to a website," "show you personalized ads based on your browsing history," 
                    and more ("How Websites and Apps Collect and Use Your Data") </li>
                <li>This is important to understand because the Pew Research Center has stated that "67% [of people] say they understand little to nothing about what companies are doing with their personal data" 
                    (McClain et al.).</li>

            <h2>The Impact This Has On Consumers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>First, companies collecting our data results in a loss of trust in them. In 2023, Wall Street Journal stated that "just 34% feel companies are clear about how they use the data they collect from users" (Hupfer).</li>
                <li>According to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), the collection of data poses a variety of risks, one of which is "biased outcomes [due to] using data that reflect biases or social inequities" ("Consumer Data: Increasing Use Poses Risks to Privacy")</li>
                <li>It can feel like a violation of our constitutional right to privacy. While this right is not explicit in the Constitution, it was inferred to be an implicit right by the Supreme Court, and therefore, we expect to have it.</li>
                <li>The degradation of the privacy of consumers' digital data directly reflects corporate greed. While using it to provide a personalized experience is helpful, companies selling your data to third parties just so they can earn more money through ads is harmful and unethical.</li>

            <h3>Cambridge Analytica</h3>
            <p>In 2013, Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting agency, "utilized 50 million Facebook profiles" to "better target political messages to people that could be influenced, also known as 'microtargeting'." Zuckerburg came under fire and "outlined 
                an investigation and full audit into apps that had access to large amounts of data" (Harbath and Fernekes). </p>

            <h3>Google</h3>
            <p>Just recently, on July 1st, 2025, "[a] jury agreed...that Alphabet's Google was liable for sending and receiving information from [Android] devices without permission while they were idle." The jury ruled that "Google...must pay more than $314.6 million
                to Android smartphone users in [California]" for the damages (Brittain).

            <h3>Apple</h3>
            <p>In January 2025, allegations came up against Apple, stating that "users of Siri-enabled devices...have had their private conversations recorded by Apple and shared with third parties without consent." To end the lawsuit, "the court has preliminarily approved a $95 million class action settlement"
                (McCroskey). </p>

            <h2>Common Misconceptions People Have about Digital Privacy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Private browsing modes</strong> stop any companies from collecting my data. On the contrary, according to the University of Chicago, "internet service providers and websites could still track user activity and information while in private mode" ("Browser Info Doesn’t Clear Up Privacy Mode Myths").</li>
                <li>I have <strong>nothing important on my computer</strong>, so I don't need to worry about my privacy. The West Virginia State Privacy Office differs, saying that "your opinion about what is important may differ from an attacker's opinion" ("Debunking Some Common Security Myths
                    "). While this is mostly relevant for data breaches, in this case, the attackers could be the companies.</li>
                <li><strong>A privacy policy</strong> will protect me from the companies collecting, selling, and using my data. Actually, these privacy policies are only required to disclose what personal information is collected, how its collected, why its collected, how its used, and who uses it ("How to Read a Privacy Policy").
                    Agreeing to one does not stop the companies from doing any of these things.

            <h2>Small Steps You Can Take</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Delete or Deactivate Old Shopping & Social Media Accounts."</strong> These accounts often contain personal information which can still be collected and used ("Reduce Your Digital Footprint").</li>
                <li><strong>"Check Your Privacy Settings."</strong> Make sure that data that you don't want to be shared is not being shared by periodically checking your privacy settings on various apps ("Reduce Your Digital Footprint").</li>
                <li><strong>"Use a Virtual Private Network."</strong> These networks will encrypt your tracking data while you browse, so that companies cannot retrieve them ("Reduce Your Digital Footprint"). However, be careful. Some scammy VPNs may steal your data themselves.</li>
