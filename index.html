            <h2>How Companies Steal and Use Your Personal Data Digitally</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Almost every time you open an app on your phone or a website on your computer, a prompt appears asking you for permission to collect and sell your personal information. They use cookies to do this.</li>
                <li>A 2025 study by the research company All About Cookies found that "40% of internet users blindly accept cookies when they get to a website" (Koebert)</li>
                <li>According to the Federal Trade Commission, companies then use third-party trackers to "gather analytics about your visit to a website," "show you personalized ads based on your browsing history," 
                    and more ("How Websites and Apps Collect and Use Your Data") </li>
                <li>This is important to understand because the Pew Research Center has stated that "67% [of people] say they understand little to nothing about what companies are doing with their personal data" 
                    ("How Americans View Data Privacy").</li>

            <h2>The Impact This Has On Consumers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>First, companies collecting our data results in a loss of trust in them. In 2023, Wall Street Journal stated that "just 34% feel companies are clear about how they use the data they collect from users" ("Tech Companies Have a Trust Gap to Overcome").</li>
                <li>According to the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), the collection of data poses a variety of risks, one of which is "biased outcomes [due to] using data that reflect biases or social inequities" ("Consumer Data: Increasing Use Poses Risks to Privacy")</li>
                <li>Lastly, it can feel like a violation of our constitutional right to privacy. While this right is not explicit in the Constitution, it was inferred to be an implicit right by the Supreme Court, and therefore, we expect to have it.</li>
